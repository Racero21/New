My childhood dream was to become an astrophysicist since I was always mesmerized by 
the stars and big phenomena happening in the universe. I used to frequent 
The National Geographic and The Discovery channel and could watch a 4 hour documentary 
about galaxies and supernova without getting bored. My dreams were very pure and 
innocent as compared to the dreams I have today.
